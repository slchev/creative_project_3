    "From a young age I was interested in photography. I noticed that if you get really close to something with a camera you can see details that you wouldnâ€™t be able to see otherwise and a whole new world opens up. I would walk around a take close up pictures of anything I could find so I could find out what they looked like zoomed in. This is how my passion for photography started to grow and continues to grow as I find new angles to look at the world."
